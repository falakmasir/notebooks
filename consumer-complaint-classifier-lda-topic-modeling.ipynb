    "\n",
    "For a service provider, customer complaints may carry a negative connotation; however, we should look to complaints as **insights** for several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are often a good indicator of what is going wrong. They can highlight to management not only about challenges with people and processes, but also can provide ideas for new products and services.\n",
    "* They provide an opportunity for the service provider to resolve the customerâ€™s problems on time and thus reduce dissatisfaction levels.\n",
    "* Customers who have had a problem resolved by a service provide effeciently, often have a stronger loyalty to the company compared with those that have *never* had a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the amount of unstructured text data that is currently on the internet - in forms of social media, product reviews, etc. This leaves businesses open to a wealth of data that they can process and then draw insights from. Text data is **notoriously** difficult to analyze; however, recent advances in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** have made it easy for data scientist and software developers to build pipelines to achieve this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use NLP to automatically group consumer complaints into topics. These topics will enable us to discover and adapt to current and emerging trends and identify problem areas. By pinpointing and these types of issues, we can make recommendations to better deliver customer service experiences.\n",

    "The [Comcast Consumer Complaints Dataset][comcast-dataset] is a public dataset compiled by [Charlie H.][charlie] on Kaggle. His motivative for uploading provides a description of the dataset: \"Comcast is notorious for terrible customer service and despite repeated promises to improve, they continue to fall short. Only last month (October 2016) the FCC fined them a cool $2.3 million after receiving [over 1000 consumer complaints][complaints]. After dealing with their customer service for hours yesterday, I wanted to find out more about others' experiences.\"\n",

    "The dataset consists of two CSV files. The first is [comcast_consumeraffairs_complaints.csv][consumeraffair-csv], which has four columns author, posted_on, rating, and text. The second is [comcast_fcc_complaints_2015.csv][fcc-csv], which has Ticket #, Customer Complaint, Date, Time, Received Via, City, State, Zip code, Status, Filing on Behalf of Someone, and Description.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use the [spaCy][spacy] library for preprocessing. This library is amazing and its tagline is 'industrial strength Natural Language Processing', which it definately lives up to. We can preprocess our complaints in just a few lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization\n",
    "Different languages will have different tokenization rules. Let's look at an example of how tokenization might work in English. For the sentence â€“ 'It's nice out today.', it would be broken up as follows, with the appropriate numerical indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "| 0  | 1  | 2    |  3  |   4   |\n",
    "|----|----|------|-----|-------|\n",
    "| It | is | nice | out | today |\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks like the result when we run `.split(' ')` in Python â€“ why do we give it a special name of tokening?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you notice carefully, the sentence has been split differenly for example: **It's** into **It** *and* **is** and punctuation has been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopwords are words which are filtered out before processing our data. Though \"stopwords\" usually refers to the most common words in a language (e.g for english, 'the', 'a', etc..) there is no single universal list of stopwords used by all natural language processing tools, and indeed not all tools even use such a list. Some tools specifically avoid removing these stopwords to support phrase search. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmatization and stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Paraphrasing [Introduction to Information Retrieval by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan and Hinrich SchÃ¼tze][ir-retrieval]: \"Stemming usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes. Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Topic** means the same as **Complaint Category**.\n",
    "* **Document** means the same as a **Complaint Verbatim**.\n",
    "* **Corpus** means the same as **all the Complaint Verbatims in the CSV**.\n",

    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic model that assumes that every topic is a bag of words and every document is a bag of topics that each can be chosen with from the bag with some probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is an unsupervised learning method. The number of topics, **k**, are left to us to determine and the *interpretation* of the topics is also left to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you have a complaint like - **\"I was charged a late fee but I paid my bill on the 16th\"**. With LDA, we will look at all the documents in our corpus and begin separting them into topics. After, for this particular document, we can say that this complaint is made up of two topics: it is 40% \"Fees\" and 60% \"Payments\". We can also say if we select a word at random from \"Fees\" we might get the word \"charged \" with a probability of 5.0% (just an example).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/), you can find a very good write-up of it by [Edwin Chen](http://blog.echen.me).\n",
